The Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation. 
- In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices.
- Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.
- Most of these directories exist in all UNIX operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.

## /root
- Every single file and directory starts from the root directory.
- Only root user has write privilege under this directory.
- Please note that /root is root user’s home directory, which is not same as /.

## /bin
- Contains binary executables.
- Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
- Commands used by all the users of the system are located here.
- For example: ps, ls, ping, grep, cp.
![/bin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98354414/222957553-624ef594-cf2a-4331-9697-149f88043e6d.png)

## /sbin
- Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
- But, the linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system aministrator, for system maintenance purpose.
- For example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon
![/sbin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98354414/222957578-7d1fcfe7-1d69-4632-b05b-9dd4837e89eb.png)

## /etc
- Contains configuration files required by all programs.
- This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
- For example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf
![/etc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98354414/222956984-a4b3400e-24f3-4652-bf35-68be0e665b6a.png)

## /dev
- Contains device files.
- These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
- For example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0
![/dev](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98354414/222957038-7e688ad1-44bf-4587-8da2-8db37d6940c2.png)

## /proc
- Contains information about system process.
- This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory contains information about the process with that particular pid.
- This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime

##  /var
- Content of the files that are expected to grow can be found under this directory.
- This includes — system log files (/var/log); packages and database files (/var/lib); emails (/var/mail); print queues (/var/spool); lock files (/var/lock); temp files needed across reboots (/var/tmp);
![/var](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98354414/222957733-88121ed2-5562-4e77-9505-e86ac1a421a7.png)

## /tmp
- Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
- Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.
![/tmp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98354414/222957760-1cc809d7-319e-49f7-931f-0fbfaf1f2c8d.png)

## /usr
- Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.
- `/usr/bin` contains binary files for user programs. If you can’t find a user binary under **/bin**, look under **/usr/bin**. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp
- ` /usr/sbin` contains binary files for system administrators. If you can’t find a system binary under **/sbin**, look under **/usr/sbin**. For example: atd, cron, sshd, useradd, userdel
- `/usr/lib` contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
- `/usr/local` contains users programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under /usr/local/apache2
- `/usr/src` holds the Linux kernel sources, header-files and documentation.

## /home
- Home directories for all users to store their personal files
- For examples: /home/john, /home/dylan.

## /boot
- Contains boot loader related files
- **Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files** are located under **/boot**
- Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot

## /lib
- Contains library files that supports the binaries located under /bin and /sbin
- Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
- For example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7

## /opt
- Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
- add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.

## /mnt
- Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.

There's a powerful command that helps us to search for files and directories in Linux called `find`. Let's discuss and learn about it!

## Basic syntax of the `Find` command

```bash
find /path/ -type f -name file-to-search
```

Where,
- `/path`  is the path where file is expected to be found. This is the starting point to search files. The path can also be `/` or `.` which represent root and current directory, respectively.
- `-type` is the type of the file that you want to search for. Learn more about [Linux File Types](https://quocdat.me/2023/03/05/linux-file-types)
- `-name` is the name of the file type that you want to search.
